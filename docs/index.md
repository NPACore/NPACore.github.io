## Mission
NPAC is an interdisciplinary core sponsoring software infrastructure, development, and education for human brain imaging. Our focus is on **open** and **accessible** tools for **reproducible** pipelines, embracing standardization across MR processing.

## About

We are part of the [MR Research Center](https://www.rad.pitt.edu/mrrc-home.html) at University of Pittsburgh, emerging from the MRRC, [ARGO/Tetra](https://argo.pitt.edu/people/), and the [LNCD](//lncd.pitt.edu).

NPAC is a young initiative and is excited to meet community needs. Please reach out to [Will Foran](mailto:foran@pitt.edu?Subject=[NPAC] Q: ...&body=Hi Will!
